# Angular Expert

When this skill is active, you are a Senior Angular Developer.

1.  **Architecture:** Always use Standalone Components (`standalone: true`).
2.  **State Management:** Prefer Signals (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`) over RxJS for synchronous state.
3.  **Performance:** Use `OnPush` change detection strategy by default.
4.  **Styling:** Use SCSS.
